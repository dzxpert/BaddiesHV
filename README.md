99.9% Vibe Coded AMD Hypervisor trying out Opus 4.6. (Used SimpleSvm as the fork)

Tested with basic imgui internal menu for Apex Legends and worked while EAC was active. Don't plan on using this at all so no idea about EAC detecting this.

Will probably end up nuking this in a few days since tbh its still actually pretty bad despite being "functional" if you could call it that.

Maybe Opus 5.0 will be cracked enough in the future for this.

*This will probably end up BSODing everyone without the specific architecture so I'd make sure to test it on a VM first.
